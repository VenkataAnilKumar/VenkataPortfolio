# Codebase Intelligence & Refactoring Engine

Design-only repository for an architecture that ingests large codebases, builds semantic understanding, and proposes safe, measurable refactorings.

## At-a-glance
- Problem: Modern codebases are massive and drift from intended architecture. Teams need automated insights and safe refactor suggestions.
- Scope: Design and documentation only. No runtime code in this repo.
- Core pillars: Ingestion & parsing, Semantic graphs, AI analysis, Refactoring planner, Safety & rollback, Developer UX.

## Architecture
See diagrams in `ARCHITECTURE/`.

- High-level: `ARCHITECTURE/high_level_diagram.png`
- Data flow: `ARCHITECTURE/data_flow_diagram.png`
- Components: `ARCHITECTURE/component_diagrams/*`

> Note: PNGs are placeholders. Replace with your diagrams (Mermaid exports or draw.io).

## Key components
- Ingestion & Parsers (polyglot) — build ASTs, symbol tables, and file metadata.
- Code Intelligence Graph — entities: files, symbols, types, dependencies, ownership, issues.
- AI Analysis Engine — smells, anti-patterns, architectural drift, duplicate code, test debt.
- Refactoring Planner — clusters changes, plans dependency-safe steps, generates diffs.
- Safety & Rollback — gating rules, CI checks, test validation, automatic reverts.
- Dev Interfaces — PR comments, IDE hints, and dashboards.

## Success metrics
| Area | Metric | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Refactoring quality | Post-refactor defect rate | -30% vs baseline |
| Maintainability | Change risk score | -25% on affected modules |
| Consistency | Cycles/instability in dependency graph | -40% |
| Velocity | Mean time to review (MTR) | -20% |
| Coverage | Critical paths without tests | -50% |
