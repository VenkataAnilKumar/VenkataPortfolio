# System Overview

This document provides a concise tour of the Codebase Intelligence & Refactoring Engine, its goals, constraints, and interactions.

## Goals
- Build a semantic understanding of large, polyglot codebases.
- Identify risks, anti-patterns, and refactoring opportunities.
- Propose safe, incremental changes with measurable outcomes.

## Non-goals
- Acting as an auto-merge bot.
- Replacing human code review.

## Core capabilities
- Code ingestion (VCS, monorepos, microservices) with language-aware parsing.
- Code Intelligence Graph (CIG): files, symbols, dependencies, ownership, issues.
- AI analyses: smells, duplication, drift, test debt, risk scoring.
- Refactoring plans: dependency-safe steps, diffs, PRs.
- Safety: policy gates, test validation, rollback.

## Primary actors
- Developers, reviewers, SRE/Platform teams, and tech leads/architects.

## High-level flows
1. Ingest → Parse → Build CIG
2. Analyze → Score → Plan
3. Validate → Gate → Propose PR
4. Monitor → Measure → Iterate
