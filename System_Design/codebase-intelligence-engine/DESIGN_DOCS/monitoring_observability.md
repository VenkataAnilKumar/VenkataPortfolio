# Monitoring & Observability

## Telemetry
- OpenTelemetry traces across ingestion → parsing → analysis → planning.
- Prometheus metrics for throughput, latency, error rates, and queue depths.

## Dashboards
- Parsing performance; analysis backlog; recommendation acceptance; test outcomes.

## Alerts
- Stuck queues; high failure rates; SLA/SLO breaches; cost budget overruns.

## Logging
- Structured logs with request IDs and project IDs; privacy filters.
