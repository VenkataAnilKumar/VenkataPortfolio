# OpenAPI Dynamic Multi-Agent Orchestration System

A production-ready platform that orchestrates multiple specialized AI agents, enabling them to collaborate via tools and external APIs described by OpenAPI/JSON Schema to accomplish complex tasks safely and efficiently.

---

## 1) Problem & Goals
- Problem: Single LLM agents struggle with complex, multi-step tasks requiring tool use, policy constraints, and coordination across services.
- Goals:
	- Dynamic multi-agent orchestration with role-specialized agents (Planner, Researcher, Toolsmith, Reviewer, Executor).
	- Safe, observable tool usage via OpenAPI contracts and policy guardrails.
	- Deterministic coordination with retries, timeouts, and circuit breakers.
	- Extensible tool registry + agent registry (plug-and-play new tools/agents).
	- Auditable runs with reproducible traces.
- Non-goals: Training new foundation models; building vendor-specific proprietary APIs.

## 2) Requirements
- Functional:
	- Register agents and tools (OpenAPI/JSON Schema) dynamically.
	- Orchestrate tasks with planning, execution, and review loops.
	- Persist sessions, messages, decisions, and results.
	- Support human-in-the-loop approvals for sensitive actions.
- Non-functional:
	- Availability 99.9% (single region), P95 orchestration step latency < 2s.
	- Throughput: 200 concurrent tasks with burst to 1k using queueing.
	- Observability: full traces, structured logs, metrics.
	- Compliance: PII redaction, configurable data retention.

## 3) High-level Architecture
```
[Client/UI] -> [API Gateway] -> [Orchestrator Service] -> [Agent Runtime Layer]
																	|             |                |
																	v             v                v
														 [Memory/DB]   [Event Bus]     [Tool Adapters]
																	|                             |
																	v                             v
													[Vector Store]                 [OpenAPI Providers]
```
Key subsystems:
- API Gateway: Auth, rate limiting, request validation.
- Orchestrator Service: Task planning, coordination, policy enforcement, audit.
- Agent Runtime: Agent loop, tool selection, reflection/review.
- Tool Adapters: OpenAPI-based connectors with schema validation and safety checks.
- Storage: Postgres (metadata), Redis (queues/cache), Vector DB (embeddings/memory).
- Event Bus: Kafka/RabbitMQ for async steps and retries.

## 4) Core Components
- Agent Registry: defines agent roles, prompts, capabilities, and policies.
- Tool Registry: OpenAPI specs, JSON Schema validators, rate limits, scopes.
- Policy Engine: allow/deny rules, PII/PHI redaction, action approvals.
- Planner: decomposes goals into steps; chooses agents and tools.
- Executor: runs tool calls with timeouts, backoff, and circuit breakers.
- Reviewer: evaluates outputs, detects hallucinations, requests re-work.
- Memory Service: episodic (session) + semantic (vector) memory APIs.
- Audit/Telemetry: spans, metrics, logs, immutable action trails.

## 5) Data Model (relational core)
- agent(id, name, role, prompt_template, capabilities[], created_at)
- tool(id, name, openapi_ref, scopes[], rate_limit, created_at)
- session(id, user_id, goal, status, created_at, updated_at)
- task(id, session_id, agent_id, step, status, input_json, output_json, started_at, finished_at)
- action(id, task_id, tool_id, request_json, response_json, status, latency_ms, retry_count)
- policy_violation(id, session_id, severity, rule, details, created_at)
- embedding(id, session_id, chunk_id, vector, metadata)

Indexes: (session_id), (task.session_id, step), (action.task_id), GIN on jsonb fields as needed.

## 6) API/Interfaces (selected)
- POST /orchestrate
	- input: { goal: string, context?: object, constraints?: object }
	- output: { sessionId: string, status: "started" | "completed" | "failed" }
- GET /sessions/{id}
	- returns session, tasks, actions, and summary
- POST /agents
	- register/patch agent definitions
- POST /tools
	- register OpenAPI tool with scopes and rate limits
- WS /streams/{sessionId}
	- server-sent updates for UI streaming

Contracts: OpenAPI 3.1 for public APIs; JSON Schema for internal action payloads.

## 7) Workflows & Sequences
1) Client calls /orchestrate with a goal.
2) Orchestrator creates session; Planner decomposes steps.
3) For each step: Agent Runtime selects agent -> selects tool -> executes via Tool Adapter.
4) Reviewer validates result; if weak/unsafe, request re-work and retry (bounded).
5) Persist all decisions and actions; stream updates to client; finalize session.

Idempotency: all write APIs accept idempotency keys; action retries use deterministic keys.

## 8) Scaling & Performance
- Horizontal scale Orchestrator and Agent Runtime; autoscale on queue depth and CPU.
- Caching: tool schema cache; recent embeddings cache; prompt template cache.
- Backpressure: queue length thresholds; admission control; priority lanes.
- Rate limiting: per-user, per-tool, and global budgets.

## 9) Reliability, Safety, Observability
- Safety: allow-list tools; scope-limited credentials; dry-run mode; human approval gates.
- Resilience: timeouts, jittered exponential backoff, circuit breakers per-tool.
- Observability: OpenTelemetry traces (session->task->action), Prometheus metrics, structured logs.
- DLQs: failed actions routed to DLQ with replay tooling.

## 10) Security
- AuthN: JWT/OAuth2; AuthZ: RBAC with resource scopes.
- Secrets: vault-managed; short-lived tokens for tool access.
- Data: TLS in transit; at-rest encryption; PII redaction pre-persist.
- Threats: prompt injection (mitigate via tool schema validation + allow-list + content filters), data exfiltration (egress policies), abuse (rate limits).

## 11) Trade-offs & Alternatives
- Centralized Orchestrator vs fully decentralized agents: chose centralized for observability and policy.
- Event-driven vs synchronous: hybrid; long steps via async events.
- JSON Schema validation adds latency but increases safety and debuggability.

## 12) Deployment & Operations
- Environments: dev/stage/prod; progressive delivery (blue/green or canary).
- Infra: Kubernetes; HPA; secrets via external secret store; IaC via Terraform.
- DR: daily backups of Postgres and vector store; RPO 15m, RTO 1h.
- Runbooks: tool outage playbook, circuit-breaker tuning, DLQ replay.

## 13) Open Questions & Next Steps
- Agent evaluation harness and golden datasets for regression.
- Cost controls: per-session budget capping, prompt compression strategies.
- Advanced memory: cross-session entity memory and summarization.
- UI: rich trace explorer and step-by-step diff view.
