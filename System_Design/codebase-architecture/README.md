# Codebase Intelligence & Refactoring Engine

An AI-assisted platform that analyzes large codebases, detects design/code smells, proposes safe refactorings, and automates changes with developer-in-the-loop approvals.

---

## 1) Problem & Goals
- Problem: Legacy and fast-growing codebases accumulate technical debt and inconsistent patterns, slowing delivery and increasing defects.
- Goals:
	- Continuously analyze code to surface architecture/code smells and risks.
	- Generate refactoring plans and patches aligned to team standards.
	- Automate mechanical refactors at scale with safety checks and approvals.
	- Provide rich diffs, impact analysis, and rollback.
- Non-goals: Fully replacing human code review; writing net-new features autonomously.

## 2) Requirements
- Functional:
	- Ingest repos (mono/multi-repo), index symbols/ASTs, and build dependency graphs.
	- Detect smells (duplication, high coupling, large classes, dead code, insecure patterns).
	- Suggest fixes and generate patches (branch/PR) with tests impacted.
	- Support policies: file/path ownership, coding standards, risk thresholds.
- Non-functional:
	- Handle repos up to 5M LOC; incremental updates in minutes.
	- P95 analysis query < 1s; batch nightly deep scans.
	- Auditability and reproducibility of suggestions.

## 3) High-level Architecture

```
Components:
- Ingestion: connects to GitHub/GitLab, handles branches, webhooks.
- Indexer: builds ASTs, symbol tables, call graphs, and embeddings.
- Analyzers: static/dynamic rules, LLM-based suggestions, custom org rules.
- Refactor Engine: safe mechanical edits, codemods, semantic patching, test updates.
- PR Bot: opens branches/PRs, posts diffs, links impacted tests and metrics.
- Storage: Graph DB (code graph), Vector DB (semantic), Postgres (metadata), Blob store (artifacts).

## 4) Core Components
- Rule Engine: pluggable analyzers (linters, taint analysis, custom queries).
- Pattern Miner: detects duplicated or near-duplicate code; suggests abstractions.
- Risk Model: scores refactors by blast radius, dependency criticality, and test coverage.
- Semantic Patcher: applies structured rewrites; verifies build/tests locally or in CI.
- Policy Gate: ownership checks, approval thresholds, compliance rules.

## 5) Data Model (high-level)
- repo(id, provider, url, default_branch, created_at)
- commit(id, repo_id, sha, author, timestamp)
- file(id, repo_id, path, language, hash, size)
- symbol(id, repo_id, file_id, name, kind, references[], definitions[])
- smell(id, repo_id, type, location, severity, evidence_json)
- suggestion(id, repo_id, smell_id, summary, diff_artifact, risk_score, status)
- run(id, repo_id, trigger, started_at, finished_at, metrics_json)

Indexes: (repo_id, path), (repo_id, type), GIN on evidence_json.

## 6) API/Interfaces (selected)
- POST /repos { url, provider, branches? }
- POST /analyze { repoId, depth?, ruleset? }
- GET /repos/{id}/smells
- POST /suggest { repoId, smellId }
- POST /refactor { suggestionId, policyOverride? }
- GET /runs/{id}

Streaming: WS/SSE for analysis progress and PR suggestions.

## 7) Workflows & Sequences
1) Ingest repo and index code graph and embeddings.
2) Run analyzers (rules + ML) to produce smells and candidates.
3) Rank with risk model; generate suggestions and semantic patches.
4) Run local build/tests; attach results and impacted tests to PR.
5) PR Bot opens PR; owners review and approve; Policy Gate enforces rules.
6) Merge; post-merge verification; rollback plan retained.

Idempotency: runs keyed by (repo, commit, ruleset) to avoid duplicate work.

## 8) Scaling & Performance
- Shard by repo; parallel index/analyze by file/package.
- Cache ASTs and embeddings; incremental updates on diffs.
- Queue long-running analyses with backpressure and priorities.

## 9) Reliability, Safety, Observability
- Observability: traces per run; metrics for analyzer latencies; logs with repo/commit labels.
- Safety: dry-run mode; require approvals for high-risk changes; semantic diff visualizer.
- Resilience: retries on provider timeouts; circuit breakers per provider.

## 10) Security
- SCM OAuth apps with least privilege; webhook secrets; signed commits optional.
- Secrets in vault; short-lived tokens for CI runners.
- Secure storage for code artifacts; audit logs for access.

## 11) Trade-offs & Alternatives
- Graph DB vs relational joins: choose graph for cross-repo symbol traversal simplicity.
- LLM suggestions vs pure rules: combine both for coverage and precision.
- Codemods risk: mitigated via tests, phased rollouts, and approvals.

## 12) Deployment & Operations
- K8s deployment; HPA based on queue length/CPU; canary for new analyzers.
- Nightly deep scans; on-push incremental runs.
- DR: backups of Postgres/Graph/Vector stores; RPO 30m; RTO 2h.

## 13) Open Questions & Next Steps
- Language coverage expansion (e.g., Java/Kotlin, Python, TS/JS, Go, Rust).
- Deeper test impact analysis integration.
- Organizational knowledge base for shared patterns and anti-patterns.
