# Project Overview & Scope

## 1. Executive Summary
The Multi-Agent Dispute Resolution System accelerates and improves financial dispute handling (fraud claims, chargebacks, merchant errors) by automating early classification, contextual enrichment, and recommended resolutions with explainable LLM reasoning. It reduces analyst workload, improves decision consistency, and surfaces emerging fraud / merchant issues sooner.

## 2. Business Value
| Dimension | Baseline Pain | Target Improvement | Measurement |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
Analyst Handling Time | 12–18 mins/case | ↓ ≥30% | Avg time/case (sample) |
Classification Precision | ~70–75% heuristic | ≥90% | Labeled validation set |
Override Rate | High (ad-hoc) | <20% Phase 2 | Analyst decision logs |
Cost/Case | $15–$75 manual | ≤$0.45 LLM + infra | Token + infra metering |
Fraud Pattern Lead Time | Multi-day | < 1 day (Phase 3) | Detection timestamp delta |
Audit Exceptions | Occasional gaps | 0 critical | Compliance review |

## 3. Scope (Initial & Phases)
| In-Scope (Phase 1–2) | Out-of-Scope (Now) | Rationale |
|----------------------|--------------------|-----------|
Dispute ingestion API | Full end-user portal/UI | API-focused MVP credibility |
Automated classification | Real-time streaming ingestion | Batch/Sync suffices early |
Evidence enrichment (transactions, prior disputes) | Complex third-party KYC integrations | Reduce external dependency risk |
Recommendation + rationale | Full automated final decision (no human) | Maintain risk control |
Audit + metrics foundation | Representment doc generation | Later revenue lever |

## 4. Success Criteria (Go/No-Go)
| Milestone | Success Threshold | Evidence |
|-----------|------------------|----------|
Prototype (P0) | Demo on 50 synthetic cases | Live walkthrough |
MVP Ready | ≥85% classification precision, stable API | Test report + OpenAPI |
Phase 2 Launch | ≥90% precision, <3s p95 classification latency | Metrics dashboard |

## 5. Stakeholders
(See root README for detailed personas.) Primary internal users early: Dispute Analysts & Fraud Investigators; Product & Compliance for governance.

## 6. Constraints & Assumptions
| Type | Statement | Risk if False |
|------|-----------|--------------|
Data | Access to historical labeled disputes (at least 500) | Slow model evaluation feedback |
LLM | Stable access to GPT models with published rate limits | Throughput throttling |
Security | Minimal PII subset allowed in model prompts | Prompt redesign / compliance delay |
Infra | Single-region deployment acceptable first 2 phases | Added latency for some geos |

## 7. KPIs & Dashboards (Initial Set)
- Cases processed per day
- Classification precision / recall (rolling)
- Override rate
- p95 classification latency
- Cost per case (USD)
- Token usage breakdown (classification vs recommendation)

## 8. High-Level Timeline (Indicative)
| Week | Focus |
|------|-------|
1 | Repo, schema, ingestion skeleton |
2 | Classification (rule + LLM) & tests |
3 | Enrichment + recommendation prompt |
4 | Audit + metrics + hardening |
5 | Precision tuning + documentation assets |

## 9. Exit Narrative (Portfolio Framing)
“Implemented an explainable LLM-driven multi-agent pipeline that automated early classification and recommendation for financial disputes, cutting manual triage time while providing auditable reasoning artifacts and cost guardrails.”
