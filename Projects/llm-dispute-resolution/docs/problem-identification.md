# Problem Identification & Opportunity Analysis

## 1. Context
High-volume financial platforms face growing dispute volumes driven by e-commerce fraud, subscription billing confusion, and increasing consumer expectations for rapid resolution.

## 2. Core Problems
| Problem | Description | Impact | Why Existing Approach Fails |
|---------|-------------|--------|-----------------------------|
High Manual Triage Load | Analysts manually read narratives & gather data | Backlogs, SLA breaches | Fragmented systems & unstructured data |
Inconsistent Classification | Heuristic/rule drift & human variation | Low recovery, misrouted cases | No centralized ML/LLM reasoning layer |
Slow Context Aggregation | Data scattered (transactions, prior disputes) | Delayed decisions | No orchestration / caching |
Weak Explainability | Decisions lack standardized rationale & policy mapping | Compliance risk | Siloed notes, no structured schema |
Late Fraud Pattern Detection | Coordinated attacks recognized post-loss | Financial exposure | No embedding / clustering pipeline |
Inefficient Cost Structure | High FTE hours per dispute | Margin compression | Lacks automation leverage |

## 3. Root Cause Analysis (5-Why Style Example)
Symptom: High handling time.
1. Analyst collects context manually → time-consuming.
2. Because data in multiple systems → no consolidation layer.
3. Because integration prioritized UI workflows over service abstraction.
4. Because legacy roadmap lacked investment in automation.
5. Because ROI case not quantified → now addressed via clear KPIs.

## 4. Opportunity
Introduce orchestrated specialized agents + LLM reasoning to unify classification, enrichment, and recommendation with an audit-first design—improving both speed and governance.

## 5. Quantified Impact Potential
- 30–40% reduction in average handling time by automating early funnel stages.
- 10–15% improved recovery via consistent classification & earlier pattern signals.
- Reduction of compliance exceptions to near zero with immutable structured audit logs.

## 6. Competitive / Landscape Notes
Point tools focus on fraud scoring OR case management; few combine multi-agent LLM reasoning + explainable audit pipeline purpose-built for disputes.

## 7. Acceptance of Problem Definition
Success: Stakeholders agree the bottleneck resides in classification + early enrichment steps; solution must be incremental, not a wholesale system replacement.
