# LLM Dispute Resolution System - Feature Enhancement Analysis

## 🔍 Current State Analysis

### ✅ What's Working Well
- **Solid Foundation**: Complete MVP with async FastAPI, database models, multi-agent orchestration
- **Clean Architecture**: Well-separated concerns, proper dependency injection, testable design
- **Production Ready**: Authentication, audit logging, metrics, error handling
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new agents, modify pipeline, integrate real services

### 🚧 Implementation Gaps & TODOs
From requirements analysis, these features are partially implemented or missing:

#### High Priority (P0) Gaps
1. **Audit Persistence**: Currently in-memory buffer only, needs DB persistence
2. **PII Redaction**: No prompt sanitization for sensitive data (SSN, email, PAN)
3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Standardized error responses with correlation IDs
4. **Model Version Tracking**: Audit trail lacks model/prompt version information
5. **Enrichment Fault Tolerance**: No graceful degradation when data sources fail

#### Medium Priority (P1) Improvements  
1. **Advanced Classification**: Currently only handles basic categories, needs full taxonomy
2. **Real LLM Integration**: Mock mode only, needs OpenAI/Claude integration
3. **Vector Similarity**: No embedding-based pattern matching
4. **Cost Tracking**: Basic placeholder, needs real token counting
5. **Security Hardening**: Input validation, rate limiting, RBAC
